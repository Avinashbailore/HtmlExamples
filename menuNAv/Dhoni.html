In June 2013, he was reported to be the 16th highest paid sportsman in the world with yearly earnings of $31 million. He is one of the most successful Indian sportsmen that the world has ever seen.   He was made the captain of the Indian Cricket team for ICC T20 World Cup in 2007. He came back from South Africa with the trophy. He was then made the permanent Captain of the Indian Cricket team for ODIs too. The very next year, he became the captain of the Test team too when he, as the then vice-captain had to take the reins against a test against Australia because Anil Kumble, who was the skipper then, was injured. Kumble declared his retirement after that series and Dhoni became the full-time test captain for India as well.  It was with Him at the helm that Team India reached No 1 in the ICC Test Ratings.</p>
